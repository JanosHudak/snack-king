            <li>1/2 cup  water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>8 tsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>    
            <li>4 tsp granulated sugar</li> 
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>      
            <li>28 raspberries (optional)</li>      
            <li>1 tsp powdered sugar</li>      
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425˚F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with Silpat or parchment paper. </li>
            <li>In a Medium saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup milk, 8 Tbsp butter, 1 tsp sugar and 1/4 tsp salt. Bring just to a boil over medium heat then remove from heat and stir in 1 cup flour all at once with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>One flour is incorporated, place back over medium heat stirring constantly for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes to release extra moisture and partially cook flour. A thin film will form on the bottom of the pan and dough will come together into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a large mixing bowl and beat using an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute to cool mixture slightly. Add 4 eggs, 1 at a time, allowing to fully incorporate between additions. Beat another minute until dough is smooth and forms a thick ribbon when pulled up.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2" round tip. Pipe 28 puffs, each 1 1/2” diameter and 1/2” tall rounds. Keep them 1" apart and avoid making peaks* but if you do get peaks, wet finger tips lightly with water and smooth them out.</li>
            <li>Bake at 425˚F for 10 minutes in the center of the oven. Without opening oven, reduce temp to 325˚F and, bake 20-22 min longer or until golden brown on top. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
