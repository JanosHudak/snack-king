# snack-king
A recipe website featuring the tastiest snacks.

This is my first task learning web development from The Odin Project. The recipe website will contain an index page, an about page and five popular fast food recipes.

The skills I've mastered with this project: 
- adding images 
- creating page structure
- making ordered and unordered lists
- creating multiple pages and connecting them with links
